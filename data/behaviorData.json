  "description": "Persuasion and behavior change strategies seek to influence how providers practice medicine and how patients make health decisions — without relying solely on financial incentives or regulatory mandates. These 'softer' policy instruments work through information, education, social norms, and nudges. While often less powerful than payment or regulatory reforms, behavioral interventions can be highly cost-effective and are essential complements to structural reforms.",
