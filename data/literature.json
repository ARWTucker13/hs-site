    "macro_takeaway": "Highlights the tension between controlling system costs and ensuring appropriate care. Cost-sharing is a blunt lever; while it improves financial Efficiency by reducing demand, it places a heavy burden on the Behavior and Access knobs by reducing both essential and non-essential utilization."

    "macro_takeaway": "Pay-for-performance produces measurable short-term gains on incentivized dimensions but risks 'teaching to the test': once targets are met, improvement stalls, while unincentivized quality dimensions deteriorate.

    "macro_takeaway": "A landmark null result demonstrating that financial incentives tied to process-of-care measures do not necessarily translate into improved hard patient outcomes.

    "methodology": "Systematic review of econometric evidence and industry documents on price elasticity of tobacco demand.",
    "finding": "The consensus price elasticity of cigarette demand is approximately -0.4 in high-income countries and -0.4 to -0.8 in low- and middle-income countries. A 10% price increase reduces consumption by 4–8%. Youth and low-income populations are most price-responsive. Industry documents confirmed that companies viewed tax increases as the greatest threat to consumption.",
    "macro_takeaway": "Establishes the empirical foundation for sin taxes as a dual-purpose health financing instrument: they generate revenue while reducing consumption of health-harming products. The Financing knob directly operates the Behavior knob through price signals, with the strongest effects on the populations at greatest risk."

    "methodology": "Logistic regression analysis of 478 NICE appraisal decisions, modeling the relationship between incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and approval probability.",
    "finding": "Technologies with ICERs below 20,000 GBP per QALY were almost always recommended; those above 30,000 GBP per QALY were frequently rejected. However, NICE also systematically weighted other factors: severity of condition, availability of alternatives, and innovation. End-of-life treatments received higher effective thresholds. The implicit threshold was approximately 20,000–30,000 GBP per QALY.",
    "macro_takeaway": "Quantifies how HTA agencies operationalize allocative efficiency in practice. NICE's threshold framework demonstrates that cost-effectiveness analysis is necessary but not sufficient — social value judgments about severity, equity, and innovation complement the quantitative evidence. The Regulation knob shapes what the Payment knob will purchase."

    "methodology": "Systematic literature review and cross-country ecological analysis of primary care indicators and health outcomes.",
    "finding": "Countries with stronger primary care systems had lower all-cause mortality, lower premature mortality, and lower infant mortality — effects that persisted after controlling for income, education, and specialist supply. Within the U.S., states with higher primary care physician-to-population ratios had better health outcomes across multiple indicators. Primary care was associated with more equitable distribution of health across socioeconomic groups.",
    "macro_takeaway": "The foundational evidence base for primary care gatekeeping models. Primary care functions as the Organizational infrastructure that translates Financing inputs into population health outcomes, with its greatest marginal effect on equity — reducing the gap in health status between advantaged and disadvantaged populations."

    "finding": "Kaiser Permanente consistently achieved 10–30% lower per-capita costs than comparable fee-for-service populations while maintaining equivalent or superior quality metrics. The mechanism was not rationing but structural: integrated medical records, aligned physician incentives (salaried multispecialty groups), and internalized coordination costs that fragmented systems externalize.",
    "macro_takeaway": "Vertical integration resolves the coordination failures inherent in fragmented delivery by internalizing the externalities of care transitions. When the Organization knob aligns governance, information systems, and physician incentives, the system achieves efficiency gains unavailable to any payment reform operating across organizational boundaries."

    "finding": "Decision aids improved knowledge (MD 13.3 points on 100-point scale), accuracy of risk perceptions, and congruence between values and choices. Patients using decision aids chose major elective surgery 20% less often and were more likely to choose conservative management. No adverse effects on satisfaction or anxiety.",
    "macro_takeaway": "The most comprehensive evidence that shared decision-making tools reduce preference-sensitive surgery rates without harming patient satisfaction. The Behavior knob — when operated through information rather than financial incentives — shifts utilization patterns by correcting the information asymmetry that drives over-treatment."

    "finding": "Nurse-led primary care produced equivalent or better health outcomes compared to physician-led care for a wide range of conditions. Patient satisfaction was equal or higher with nurse-led care. Consultations were longer but generated similar numbers of prescriptions, investigations, and referrals. No evidence of worse outcomes for any condition studied.",
    "macro_takeaway": "Provides the empirical foundation for expanding scope-of-practice regulation. When nurses are authorized to substitute for physicians in primary care, quality is maintained while workforce capacity expands — directly addressing the access constraints created by physician-dependent Organizational models."
