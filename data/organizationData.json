  "description": "Organization refers to how the institutions that deliver healthcare are structured, owned, and governed. Organizational design determines the relationships between hospitals, clinics, physicians, and other providers — shaping whether they compete or collaborate, whether they are publicly accountable or market-driven, and how resources flow through the system. These structural choices profoundly influence efficiency, quality, and the distribution of care across populations.",
