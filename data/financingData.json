  "description": "Health system financing is the process by which revenues are generated and pooled to pay for health services. Revenue generation determines where money comes from — taxes, insurance premiums, out-of-pocket payments, or external aid. Risk pooling determines how those funds are aggregated so that the financial risk of healthcare costs is shared across a population rather than borne by individuals at the moment of illness. The choice of financing mechanism fundamentally shapes who has access to care, how much financial protection people receive, and what incentives providers face.",
